# travel-map

Little CSS/HTML piece that displays a faint grey world map (Van der Grinten projection) as webpage. When hovering over a country/region, it is highlighted in blue.

This could potentially be made better to include different layers that signify for example gas price, safety for tourists, visa requirements, road quality, amount of interesting sights, etc etc. This could then give kind of an estimation as to if it's worth to travel there or not.
